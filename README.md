Rewrite of MVVM with Combine tutorial using MVC

[this is MVVM with Combine tutorial on raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com/4161005-mvvm-with-combine-tutorial-for-ios)

This repo removes all view models from tutorial, and refactor it in usual MVC sense.

It does the same thing with fewer codes, and is better overall.

It's an example why you don't need MVVM.
